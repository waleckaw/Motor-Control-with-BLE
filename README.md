Features:
---------

- Automatic device pairing + user API to script interactions with DC Motor or control directly from ÂµPython REPL ([BLE_Class.py](https://github.com/waleckaw/esp32_BLE_MotorControl/blob/master/BLE_Class.py))
- PI motor control module ([MC_Class.py](https://github.com/waleckaw/esp32_BLE_MotorControl/blob/master/MC_Class.py))
- Flexible synchronous scheduler to manage multiple tasks ([WWsched.py](https://github.com/waleckaw/esp32_BLE_MotorControl/blob/master/WWsched.py))
- Central (client) BLE module can be used standalone as BLE discovery device to discover, display packet info, and connect to nearby advertising peripherals
- Peripheral also compatible with [Bluetility](https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility/releases) (Mac) + other BLE peripheral discovery/interaction platforms like [ST BLE Sensor for iOS/Android](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stblesensor.html)
